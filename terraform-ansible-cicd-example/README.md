# terraform-ansible-cidc-example

Example code to create an AWS environment and build a LEMP stack via Bitbucket CI/CD pipline in Bitbucket using Terraform and Ansible. Leverages Vault for Secret Management and an S3 Remate Backend for central State management.

This example will also require a funcional instance of Vault with working secrets (or a small rewrite passing variables from within the repository variables).

Pipeline leverages Hashicorp's official Terraform Docker Image and Python's official 2.7.13 Image for use in build process.
