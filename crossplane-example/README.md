# crossplane-example

Example code to deploy Crossplane tooling and AWS Controllers to kubernetes and provision some basic resources.

To run you will first need a running kubernetes cluster, for development purposes this can be a development system such as [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
