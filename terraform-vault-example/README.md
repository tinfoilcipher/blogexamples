# terraform-vault-example

Example code to create Hashicorp Vault secrets via Terraform.

Files intended for use in conjuction with the blog post [Terraform and Vault - Automating Secret Creation](https://tinfoilcipher.co.uk/2020/05/27/terraform-and-vault-automating-secret-creation).

To run, first download [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). A functional instance of Vault is required to execute code, [see here](https://tinfoilcipher.co.uk/2020/04/09/hashicorp-vault-secure-installation-and-setup ) for a guide on a minimal Vault setup.
