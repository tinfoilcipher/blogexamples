# terraform-vault-example

Example code to create Hashicorp Vault secrets via Terraform.

Files intended for use in conjuction with the blog post [Terraform and Vault - Automating Secret Creation](https://www.tinfoilcipher.co.uk/terraform-and-vault-automating-secret-creation).

To run, first download Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). A functional instance of Vault is required to execute code, [see here](https://www.tinfoilcipher.co.uk/hashicorp-vault-secure-installation-and-setup) for a guide on a minimal Vault setup.
